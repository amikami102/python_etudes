# Python Ã©tudes

This repository holds my Python practice codes except for the yearly set of solutions to Advent of Code, which are stored in [a separate repository](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode). The folders are named after websites and books from which the exercises are taken. 

## [Python morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com) by Trey Hunner

I've been subscribed to Python morsels since 2020 except a brief pause in 2021. I owe to Python morsels for improving my coding skills and Python (and non-Python specific) concepts such as iterators and duck typing. Even though all of my solutions to the exercises I've solved are saved on my Python morsels account and I don't really need to keep them on file, I find a lot of code used in the solutions very helpful. I've even used some of them in real life (and for solving other exercises in this repository).


## [*Classic Computer Science Problems in Python* by David Kopec](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python)

I've finished going through the codes in this book in June 2023. The scripts in this folder are refactored versions of Kopec's codes and include solutions to some of the end-of-the-chapter exercises.

I think this is a good book for non-computer science, intermediate-level Python learners to practice writing Python code to solve puzzles. Kopec's code only uses the standard libraries including scripts for k-means clustering and neural network, which pretty much put my MacBook out of use while the program was running. There is a lot of refactoring you can do to make the code more up to date (especially with the recent update on `typing` module) and Pythonic (e.g. constructing lists with comprehension instead of `for` loop).
