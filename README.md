# Python Ã©tudes

This repository holds my Python practice codes except for the yearly set of solutions to Advent of Code, which are stored in [a separate repository](https://github.com/amikami102/AdventOfCode). The folders are named after websites and books from which the exercises are taken. 

## [Python morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com) by Trey Hunner

(Currently active since 2021)

I've been subscribed to Python morsels since 2020 except for a brief pause in 2021. I owe to Trey Hunner's Python Morsels for improving my coding skills and knowledge of Python (and non-Python specific) concepts such as iterators and duck typing. Even though all of my solutions to the exercises I've solved are saved on my Python morsels account and I don't really need to keep them on file, I find a lot of code used in the solutions very helpful. I've even used some of them in real life (and for solving other exercises in this repository).


## [*Classic Computer Science Problems in Python*](https://www.manning.com/books/classic-computer-science-problems-in-python) by David Kopec

(Finished in June 2023)

The scripts in this folder are refactored versions of Kopec's codes and include solutions to some of the end-of-the-chapter exercises.

I think this is a good book for non-computer science, intermediate-level Python learners to practice writing Python. Kopec's code only uses the standard libraries even for implementation of k-means clustering and neural network (obviously not recommended for actual use). There is a lot of refactoring you can do to make the code more up to date (especially with the recent update on `typing` module) and Pythonic (e.g. constructing lists with comprehension instead of `for` loop). I can't speak for the computer science side of this book, but I found it accessible and enough to give me a foothold to read the next level of material.
